# c00lhawk607
## Who?
My name is Jordan Dixon, otherwise known as c00lhawk607. I first got my name when getting a random one from sony and it just kinda stuck. A few years ago, I got my hands around the programming language Python and fell in love. I am now addicted to coding and learning new programming languages.
## Any Projects?
Yep. Several, I made a detective login, a few flask websites, and a new project called H4CK3R5 D0C.
## That's all folks!
